Deep Bass! Stone and bell textures and arpeggios. Suitable for cave level or puzzle game. Easy for perfect loop. I have precompressed this to be optimal for web distribution with VBR, I assure you the quality is 100% and better than 128kbps even if it looks like the sample rate and bitrate are lower.
