My game and soundtrack are 100% free -- there's over 50 great songs on the soundtrack, plus I have more fun trance/ambient music on http://cynicmusic.com for free --- you can stream it on my website anytime with the built in player.

I also made 40 Sonic The Hedgehog remixes in trance/ambient style you can stream them or download all of them free: http://sonic.tcpmusic.com/
